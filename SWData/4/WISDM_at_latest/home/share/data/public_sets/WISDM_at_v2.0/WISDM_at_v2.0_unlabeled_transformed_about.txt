For our transformation process, we take 10 seconds worth of
accelerometer samples (200 records/lines in the raw file)
and transform them into a single example/tuple of 46 values.
Most of the features we generate are simple statistical
measures.

user is the id number of the user that the data is from.

X0..x9, Y0..Y9, Z0..Z9 are bins, their values are the fraction
        of accelerometer samples that fell within that bin

XAVG, YAVG, ZAVG are the average x, y, and z values over the
        200 records in the example.

XPEAK, YPEAK, ZPEAK are approximations of the dominant
        frequency. First, the greatest value in the series is
        identified, then all local peak values within 10% of
        its amplitude are identified. If the number of peaks
        is less than 3, then the threshhold is lowered until
        at least 3 peaks can be found. The times between
	consecutive peaks are summed and divided by the number
        of peaks.


XABSOLDEV, YABSOLDEV, ZABSOLDEV are the average absolute
        deviations from the mean value for each axis.

XSTANDDEV, YSTANDDEV, ZSTANDDEV are the standard deviations
        for each axis.

RESULTANT is the average of the square roots of the sum of the values
   of each axis squared ï¿½(xi^2 + yi^2 + zi^2).

class is the activity that the user was performing during this example.
